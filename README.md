## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This project was created as part of an IT Analyst portfolio.

Its main goal is to practice defining **user stories** and writing **tasks** for a development team. 
The application simulates a simple Scrabble-like game, which serves as a context for creating functional requirements, acceptance criteria and testing scenarios.

Feel free to explore the documented [user stories -> Kanban board](https://github.com/users/rkarolina/projects/3)
